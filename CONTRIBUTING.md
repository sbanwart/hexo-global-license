Bugs and feature requests can be entered into the GitHub issue tracker.

## Pull Requests and Code Contributions

Please file an issue before opening a pull request. I would hate for somebody 
to invest their time working on a code contribution only to find out that it 
will not be merged for whatever reason. By opening a issue first, we can 
discuss the proposed change prior to writing code.

Once the changes have been discussed and approved, feel free to open the pull 
request.
